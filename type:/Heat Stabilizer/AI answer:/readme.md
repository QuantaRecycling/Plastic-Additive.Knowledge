Heat stabilizers in polymers are additives that prevent or reduce degradation of polymers due to heat exposure, particularly during processing and use. They enhance the thermal stability of polymers, allowing them to withstand higher temperatures without significant physical or chemical changes. These stabilizers can be organic or inorganic and are essential for many polymer applications, especially for polymers like PVC that are susceptible to thermal degradation. 
How Heat Stabilizers Work:
Preventing oxidation:
Heat stabilizers can act as antioxidants, preventing or slowing down the oxidation of the polymer, which is a major cause of degradation. 
Neutralizing decomposition products:
For example, in PVC, they can neutralize the hydrogen chloride released during thermal decomposition, preventing further degradation. 
Replacing weakened bonds:
They can also help to replace weakened carbon-chlorine bonds in polymers like PVC, which can initiate chain reactions leading to degradation. 
Types of Heat Stabilizers:
Organotin compounds: These are widely used in PVC and are highly effective. 
Mixed metal salts: These are common in flexible PVC applications, often containing calcium, zinc, barium, and cadmium. 
Metal soaps: These can be used as heat stabilizers, especially in PVC. 
Organic phosphites and phosphonites: These are used as secondary antioxidants and are effective in various polymer applications. 
Epoxy compounds: These are often used in food packaging applications. 
Lead compounds: Lead stabilizers are widely used and cost-effective, particularly for PVC applications.
